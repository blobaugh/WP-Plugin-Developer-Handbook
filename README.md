Hi! Thanks for checking out the WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook.

## Overview

Writing a plugin can be a useful way of extending WordPress to meet your functional requirements. The goal of the Plugin Developer Handbook is to be a comprehensive, but not definitive, resource for creating a WordPress plugin.

**It will** address many best practices and common development projects.

**It won't** answer every question you may come across while building your plugin.

If you find it useful, hopefully you'll set aside a bit of time to contribute back!
