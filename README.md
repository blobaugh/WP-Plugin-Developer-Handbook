Hi! Thanks for checking out the WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook.

## Overview

Writing a plugin can be a useful way of extending WordPress to meet your functional requirements. The goal of the Plugin Developer Handbook is to be a comprehensive, but not definitive, resource for creating a WordPress plugin.

**It will** address many best practices and what you might do on common development projects.

**It won't** answer every question you may come across while building your plugin.

If you find it useful, hopefully you'll set aside a bit of time to contribute back!

## How To Contribute

As you see, the Plugin Developer Handbook is living in a Github repo. It also [lives on WordPress.org](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/). The Github repo is an experiment to see if we can get more developers to contribute.

Our hypothesis: because Git(hub) is quickly becoming an integral part of every developer's workflow, it's much easier to grok how to contribute documentation in small parts. You can create issues for documentation you'd like to see, open pull requests with documentation you have to contribute, and participate in an open, highly-functional editing / review process.
