# Custom Post Types

The pivotal part of any Content Management System ( CMS ) is of course the content. WordPress comes with several different types of content predefined, such as posts, pages, and attachments. Beginning with WordPress 3.0 several powerful features for creating and managing your own custom types of content have been created. 

At its core all WordPress content types are represented as posts with a type declaration, or more simply Custom Post Types. Custom Post Types allow you to extend WordPress to handle any type of content or data imaginable, from content revealed to website visitors on the front end to private notes only available to site administrators to logs that are generally hidden to users and only available to developers.
