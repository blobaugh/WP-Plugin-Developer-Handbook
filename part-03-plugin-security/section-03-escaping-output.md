## Plugin Security: Escaping Output

As we mentioned in the introduction, every time a post title, post meta value, or some other data from the database is rendered to the user, we need to make sure it’s properly *escaped*. Escaping helps us prevent issues like malformed HTML or the dreaded cross-site scripting attack.

### Escaping: Securing Output

WordPress thankfully has a few helper functions we can use for most of what we'll commonly need to do:

`esc_html()` we should use anytime our HTML element encloses a section of data we're outputting.

```
<h4><?php echo esc_html( $title ); ?></h4>
```

`esc_url()` should be used on all URLs, including those in the 'src' and 'href' attributes of an HTML element.

```
<img src="<?php echo esc_url( $great_user_picture_url ); ?>" />
```

`esc_js()` is intended for inline Javascript.

```
<a href="#" onclick="<?php echo esc_js( $custom_js ); ?>">Click me</a>
```

`esc_attr()` can be used on everything else that's printed into an HTML element's attribute.

@todo example for esc_attr()

It's important to note that most WordPress functions properly prepare the data for output, and you don't need to escape again.

```
<h4><?php the_title(); ?></h4>
```

@todo include note of wp_post_kses()

### Conclusion

Whenever you're rendering data from the database, you'll want to make sure it's properly escaped. Escaping helps prevent issues like cross-site scripting.
